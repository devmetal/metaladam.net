## Main skills and interests

My primary ineterests are **JavaScript** and **nodejs**. I am working in backend and in frontend too.
I use **expressjs** and **mongo** most of the time. But i had experience with postgresql, and mysql from old php times.

I also love **golang** and have some experience with it. I use it for algorithmic problem solving, but i excercise myself with udemy go videos.

In frontend i have a tons of experience with javascript, angular1, **react**, **redux**, react router and also universal apps. I know the most important builder tools wich is **webpack** and **browserify**. I have experiences with **gulp** and also a little bit of grunt.

I know well the **ES** standards and i try to follow and use the latests features as i can. I know **babel** but i also know what standards are implemented in nodejs versions and browsers. I also like HTML5 features for example WebWorkers and WebSockets.

For unit testing i like to use the same technology in backend and frontend too. I know the most used testing frameworks wich are **jasmine**, **mocha** and **jest**. I also know the spy and mock apis from **sinon**.
I used to work with selenium for automated testing but nowadays i work with **nightmare**.

I also know stacks and cli tools like **MERN**, **MEAN**, **create-react-app** and **next**.
